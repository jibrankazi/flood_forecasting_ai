# AI-Powered Flood Forecasting and Climate Resilience

## Project Overview

This project aims to build an AI-powered system that forecasts riverine flooding within the Toronto area and produces inundation maps, supporting climate resilience efforts. It will leverage hydrometric, meteorological, topographic, and ancillary data to train machine learning models capable of predicting water levels and inundation extents.

## Motivation

Floods are among the most damaging natural disasters, causing loss of life and economic disruption. Accurate forecasting and early warning can save lives and reduce damages. By integrating open data sources and advanced analytics, this project seeks to contribute to community preparedness and climate resilience.

## Repository Structure

- `data/` – raw and processed datasets
  - `raw/` – original downloaded data (do not edit)
  - `processed/` – cleaned and feature-engineered data ready for analysis
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, feature engineering, model development, and evaluation
- `src/` – source code for data ingestion, processing, modeling, and utilities
- `models/` – trained model artifacts
- `reports/` – generated analysis reports and summaries
- `visualizations/` – plots, maps, and other visual outputs

## Getting Started

Detailed setup instructions, data sources, methodology, and results will be added as the project progresses. Stay tuned for updates.
